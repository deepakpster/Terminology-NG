        <strong>How it works</strong>
        <p>
            We provide a native wrapper for Terminology-NG web page.</br> Installer provides the desktop application.</br>
            We did this because we were tired of having to âŒ˜-tab or alt-tab to the browser and then search through the numerous open tabs when we were using other tabs.
